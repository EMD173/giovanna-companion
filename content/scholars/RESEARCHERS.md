## Dr. Edward Carr & Dr. V. Mark Durand

**Contribution**: Functional Communication Training (FCT)

Developed FCT, which teaches that challenging behaviors often serve a communicative function. By teaching alternative ways to communicate the same need, the challenging behavior decreases—not through punishment, but through skill-building.

**Giovanna Feature**:

- Learning Hub → "Functional Communication" article
- ABC Logger → "Function" field for logging antecedent-behavior-consequence

**Citation**:

## Dr. Steven Kapp

**Contribution**: Autistic Stimming Research

Led groundbreaking participatory research asking autistic adults about their own experiences of stimming. Found that stimming serves essential regulatory functions and that suppression causes harm.

**Giovanna Feature**:

- Learning Hub → "Stimming" article (cites this study directly)
- Guardrails → Blocks "quiet hands" language and suppression framing

**Citation**:

## Dr. Stephen Porges

**Contribution**: Polyvagal Theory

Developed polyvagal theory, which explains how the autonomic nervous system moves between states of safety (social engagement), danger (fight/flight), and life-threat (freeze/shutdown). This reframes "misbehavior" as nervous system state.

**Giovanna Feature**:

- Lens Cards → Nervous System lens ("Is your child in fight, flight, or freeze?")
- Learning Hub → Meltdown vs Tantrum distinction

**Citation**:

## Dr. Mona Delahooke

**Contribution**: Beyond Behaviors / Neurodevelopmental Lens

Clinical psychologist who translates polyvagal theory and neuroscience into accessible guidance for parents and educators. Her work emphasizes looking "beneath the behavior" to the nervous system.

**Giovanna Feature**:

- Learning Hub → Meltdown vs Tantrum article (nervous system framing)
- Lens Cards → "Behavior as Message" prompt

## Anne Donnellan

**Contribution**: Presuming Competence (Criterion of the Least Dangerous Assumption)

Articulated the principle that when we don't know a person's internal capabilities, we should assume competence rather than incompetence—because the consequences of underestimating someone are more harmful than overestimating.

**Giovanna Feature**:

- AI System Prompt → "Assume competence" is principle #3
- Guardrails → Rejects "mental age" and "low-functioning" language

**Citation**:
Donnellan, A. M. (1984). The criterion of the least dangerous assumption. *Behavioral Disorders*, 9(2), 141–150. <https://doi.org/10.1177/019874298400900201>

## Judy Singer

**Contribution**: Coined "Neurodiversity"

Sociologist who, in her 1998 thesis, coined the term "neurodiversity" to describe the natural variation in human neurology. This term became foundational to the neurodiversity movement.

**Giovanna Feature**:

- Entire app philosophy → Difference, not deficit
- Guardrails → Blocks "cure" and "suffering from" language

**Citation**:
