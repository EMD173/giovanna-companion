# Language Guide

> How we talk about autism and disability matters. This guide explains the language patterns Giovanna uses and why—while acknowledging that preferences vary within the community.

---

## Core Principle: Respect, Not Rules

> [!NOTE]
> **Language preferences vary.** Many autistic self-advocates prefer identity-first language ("autistic person"), while some prefer person-first ("person with autism"). The autistic community is not a monolith. When possible, ask individuals their preference. When speaking generally, we follow the preferences most commonly expressed by autistic self-advocates.

## Language We Avoid → Language We Use

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Instead | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| "Low-functioning" | "High support needs" | Function labels are inaccurate—someone may need high support in some areas and low in others |
| "High-functioning" | "Lower support needs" (or just describe specific needs) | "High-functioning" often means "we ignore your struggles" |
| "Suffering from autism" | "Is autistic" or "Has autism" | Autism is not a disease or tragedy |
| "Afflicted with" | "Has" | Same as above |
| "Special needs" | "Disability" or "Support needs" | "Special" often means segregated or lesser |
| "Mentally retarded" | "Intellectual disability" | Outdated and offensive terminology |
| "Mental age of X" | "Developmental level in [specific area]" | Comparing adults to children is dehumanizing |
| "Normal" children | "Neurotypical" or "non-autistic" | "Normal" implies the child is abnormal |
| "Autism epidemic" | Increased identification / awareness | Autism is not a disease; rates reflect better diagnosis |
| "Quiet hands" | (Don't say this) | Suppresses essential self-regulation |

## Identity-First vs. Person-First

### What's the Difference?

- **Identity-first**: "autistic person" — autism is part of identity
- **Person-first**: "person with autism" — separates person from condition

### Why We Default to Identity-First

Large surveys of the autistic community consistently show a preference for identity-first language. Autistic self-advocates argue that:

- Autism is inseparable from who they are (you don't say "person with femaleness")
- Person-first was designed for conditions people acquire or suffer from
- Person-first implies autism is negative and needs distancing

### But It's Not Universal

Some autistic people prefer person-first, especially those diagnosed later or from professional/clinical backgrounds. When in doubt, ask.

### Giovanna's Approach

We default to identity-first ("autistic") in our content but accept both in user input. Our guardrails don't flag person-first language—they flag *deficit* language.

## Compliance-Focused Language to Avoid

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Instead |
|----------|-----------|
| "Make them stop" | "Understand why they..." or "Support regulation" |
| "Force them to" | "Encourage" or "Help them" |
| "Non-compliant" | "Not yet able to" or "Needs support with" |
| "Extinguish the behavior" | "Address the underlying need" |
| "Despite their autism" | "As an autistic person" |
| "Overcoming autism" | "Thriving as an autistic person" |
| "Cure autism" | (Don't say this—autism is not a disease) |

---

## Cure and Fix Language

Giovanna's guardrails block language that frames autism as something to be cured or fixed:

- ❌ "Cure autism"
- ❌ "Fix their autism"
- ❌ "Recovered from autism"
- ❌ "Trapped inside" autism

This language is harmful because:

1. Autism is neurological, lifelong, and not a disease
2. It implies the autistic person is broken or defective
3. It has been used to justify harmful "treatments"

## Self-Advocacy Resources

These organizations are led by or prioritize autistic people:

| Organization | Focus | Link |
|--------------|-------|------|
| **Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN)** | Policy, rights, resources | <https://autisticadvocacy.org> |
| **Autistic Women & Nonbinary Network (AWN)** | Gender-diverse autistic community | <https://awnnetwork.org> |
| **Communication First** | Non-speaking advocacy | <https://communicationfirst.org> |
| **NeuroClastic** | Autistic-run publications | <https://neuroclastic.com> |

### Key ASAN Resources

- [Identity-First Language](https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/identity-first-language/) — Why ASAN uses identity-first
- [About Autism](https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/about-autism/) — Autistic-led explanation of autism

## A Note on "ABA"

Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is the context Giovanna operates in. Our position:

- We don't condemn all ABA or all ABA practitioners
- We acknowledge that some forms of ABA have caused harm, particularly historical practices focused on eliminating autistic traits
- We center neurodiversity-affirming principles within ABA contexts
- We translate problematic ABA terminology into respectful language

Giovanna exists to help families navigate ABA services with dignity intact.

## When You're Unsure

If you're unsure how to phrase something:

1. **Ask the person** (when possible)
2. **Check ASAN's resources**
3. **Focus on specifics** over labels ("needs support with transitions" vs. "low-functioning")
4. **Center dignity** — Would the person feel respected by this language?
