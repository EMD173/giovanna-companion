# Core Principles

> Five principles that guide everything in Giovanna. Each includes a parent-friendly explanation, where it appears in the app, what we avoid, citations, and a script for talking to schools.

## 1. Behavior Is Communication, Not Defiance

### The Principle

When a child acts in challenging ways, they are communicating something—a need, a discomfort, an overwhelm—not trying to manipulate or defy you.

### Parent-Friendly Explanation

Your child isn't giving you a hard time—they're *having* a hard time. That tantrum, that refusal, that meltdown? It's their nervous system saying "something is wrong" in the only way it can right now. Our job is to decode the message, not punish the messenger.

### How This Appears in Giovanna

- **ABC Logger**: Prompts you to identify the "function" of a behavior (escape, attention, access, sensory)
- **Lens Cards → "Behavior as Message"**: "If this behavior could talk, what would it say?"
- **Learning Hub → Functional Communication**: Explains behavior as communication attempt

### What We Avoid

- Framing behavior as "manipulation" or "testing limits"
- Punishment-first responses
- Language like "they know better" when they may not have the skill yet

### How to Say This to School
>
> "We understand behavior as communication. When [child's name] does [specific behavior], it usually means they're overwhelmed or need something they don't yet have words for. Rather than consequences, we'd appreciate a pause to ask: 'What are they trying to tell us?' This approach, called Functional Communication Training, has strong research support."

## 2. Regulation Over Compliance

### The Principle

A regulated child can learn. A dysregulated child cannot. Prioritize helping children feel safe and calm before expecting them to follow instructions.

### Parent-Friendly Explanation

You can't teach a child to swim while they're drowning. When your child is in fight-or-flight mode, their thinking brain is offline. The first job is always to help them feel safe. Once they're regulated, *then* we can talk, teach, or set expectations.

### How This Appears in Giovanna

- **Lens Cards → Nervous System**: "Regulation comes before instruction"
- **Learning Hub → Meltdown vs Tantrum**: Distinguishes neurological overwhelm from goal-oriented behavior
- **Crisis Plan**: Prioritizes de-escalation before any teaching moments

### What We Avoid

- "Make them stop" framing
- Immediate consequences during meltdowns
- Treating dysregulation as willful noncompliance

> "When [child's name] is dysregulated, their nervous system is in survival mode—their thinking brain isn't available. We prioritize helping them feel safe and calm first. We'd appreciate the school team pausing demands during these moments and focusing on co-regulation. Teaching can happen once they're back to a calm state."

## 3. Assume Competence

### The Principle

When we don't know what someone understands or can do, we should assume they understand more than they can show—not less.

### Parent-Friendly Explanation

Just because your child can't *show* you something doesn't mean they don't *know* it. They might understand everything you're saying even if they can't respond. They might have opinions even if they can't express them yet. Always treat them as the intelligent person they are.

### How This Appears in Giovanna

- **AI System Prompt**: "Assume competence" is principle #3
- **Guardrails**: Flags language like "mental age" or "low-functioning"
- **Personal Support Plan**: Starts with strengths, not deficits

### What We Avoid

- "Mental age" comparisons
- Talking about the child in front of them as if they don't understand
- Lowered expectations without evidence

### Citation

### How to Say This to School
>
> "We follow the 'least dangerous assumption'—when we're unsure what [child's name] understands, we assume competence rather than incompetence. The research shows that underestimating children causes more harm than overestimating them. Please speak to [child's name] as the intelligent person they are, even when they can't respond in typical ways."

## 4. Protect Self-Regulatory Behaviors

### The Principle

Stimming (self-stimulatory behavior like rocking, hand-flapping, or humming) is a natural and essential regulation tool. It should not be suppressed unless it causes physical harm.

### Parent-Friendly Explanation

That rocking? That humming? That spinning? It's not a problem—it's a *solution*. Your child's body has found a way to regulate itself. When we stop stimming, we take away their regulation tool, and things usually get *worse*, not better. Safe stimming should be allowed.

### How This Appears in Giovanna

- **Learning Hub → Stimming**: Full article explaining stimming as regulation
- **Guardrails**: Blocks recommendations to "quiet hands" or stop stimming
- **AI System Prompt**: "Never recommend extinction of self-regulatory behaviors"

### What We Avoid

- "Quiet hands" demands
- Stopping safe stims because they "look different"
- Treating stimming as a behavior to eliminate

### Citation

Kapp, S. K., et al. (2019). "People should be allowed to do what they like": Autistic adults' views and experiences of stimming. *Autism*, 23(7), 1782–1792. <https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361319829628>

### How to Say This to School
>
> "[Child's name] uses repetitive movements (stimming) to regulate their nervous system. Research by autistic scholars shows that suppressing stimming increases anxiety and decreases learning capacity. Unless the behavior is unsafe, please allow it. If it seems disruptive, we can work together on less visible alternatives—but never elimination."

## 5. Co-Regulation Before Self-Regulation

### The Principle

Children learn to regulate themselves through thousands of experiences of being regulated by calm, attuned adults. Before expecting self-regulation, we must provide co-regulation.

### Parent-Friendly Explanation

Nobody learns to calm down alone. Children borrow our calm. When we slow our breathing, lower our voice, and stay present, they can begin to settle. Over time, they internalize this—but it takes years, not moments. Your calm is their anchor.

### How This Appears in Giovanna

- **Lens Cards**: Prompts caregivers to check *their own* state, not just the child's
- **Homeplace Supports → Trusted People**: Documents who helps the child regulate
- **Crisis Plan → De-escalation Steps**: Emphasizes caregiver-led calming

### What We Avoid

- "Calm down!" as an instruction (doesn't work)
- Expecting children to self-regulate before they've had enough co-regulation
- Blaming children for "not trying" to calm down

### How to Say This to School
>
> "[Child's name] is still developing self-regulation skills. The developmental research shows that self-regulation grows out of repeated co-regulation experiences with calm adults. When they're upset, they need an adult to be their 'anchor'—using a calm voice, slow movements, and low demands. Telling them to 'calm down' won't help; *being* calm with them will."
