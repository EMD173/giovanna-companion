## Why This Matters

You deserve to know whose work guides your child's support. This app isn't built on assumptions—it's built on decades of research, clinical wisdom, and the lived experience of autistic self-advocates.

By being transparent about our sources, you can:

- **Verify** that our guidance is grounded in real scholarship
- **Learn more** by exploring the original work
- **Advocate** with confidence, citing the same sources we use

## Evidence Types

We distinguish between different types of knowledge:

| Type | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Peer-Reviewed Research** | Published in academic journals, often with controlled studies |
| **Clinical Literature** | Professional books, treatment manuals, clinical consensus |
| **Community Knowledge** | Wisdom from autistic self-advocates and disability communities |
| **Designer Framework** | Original frameworks created for this app |

This distinction matters. A peer-reviewed study and a popular book both have value—but they're different kinds of evidence.
