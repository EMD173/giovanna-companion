# Theoretical Frameworks

> These frameworks shape how Giovanna thinks about behavior, regulation, and support. Each section explains what the framework is, how it appears in the app, and what it does NOT claim.

## 1. Polyvagal Theory

### What It Is

A neurophysiological framework developed by Dr. Stephen Porges explaining how the autonomic nervous system responds to safety and threat. It describes three states: ventral vagal (calm, connected), sympathetic (fight/flight), and dorsal vagal (freeze/shutdown).

### How It Shows Up in Giovanna

- **Lens Cards → Nervous System lens**: Prompts like "Is your child in a calm, alert, fight, flight, or freeze state?"
- **Regulation language**: We prioritize "regulation" over "behavior management"
- **Co-regulation emphasis**: The app emphasizes caregiver state affecting child state

### What It Does NOT Claim

- Polyvagal theory is not a treatment protocol—it's a framework for understanding
- It does not diagnose conditions or prescribe specific interventions
- Some neuroscientists debate aspects of the theory; we use its accessible explanatory value

## 2. Neurodiversity Paradigm

### What It Is

A framework that views neurological differences (autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.) as natural variations in human neurology rather than deficits to be cured. Coined by sociologist Judy Singer in her 1998 thesis.

### How It Shows Up in Giovanna

- **Guardrails system**: Blocks language like "suffering from autism" or "cure"
- **AI system prompt**: "Assume competence" is a core principle
- **Strength-based framing**: The app asks about interests and strengths, not just deficits

### What It Does NOT Claim

- Neurodiversity does not deny that autism can involve challenges or that support is needed
- It does not claim all autistic people experience autism the same way
- It's a paradigm (a way of seeing), not a treatment method

## 3. Co-Regulation Theory

### What It Is

The understanding that children develop self-regulation through repeated experiences of being regulated by a calm, responsive caregiver. Before we can self-regulate, we learn to co-regulate.

### How It Shows Up in Giovanna

- **Lens Cards → all lenses**: Prompts consider the caregiver's state, not just the child's
- **Homeplace Supports**: Documents trusted people who help the child regulate
- **"Regulation comes before instruction"**: Explicit in Learning Hub content

### What It Does NOT Claim

- Co-regulation is not a single technique—it's a developmental principle
- It doesn't mean parents are "failing" if their child struggles to regulate

## 4. Trauma-Informed Care

### What It Is

An approach that recognizes how trauma affects the nervous system and behavior, and designs environments and responses to avoid re-traumatization while supporting healing.

### How It Shows Up in Giovanna

- **Crisis Plan schema**: Includes "what helps" AND "what makes it worse"
- **Share Packets**: Allows families to disclose only what they choose
- **Avoidance of punishment framing**: The app never recommends punishment for meltdowns

### What It Does NOT Claim

- Trauma-informed does not mean assuming everyone is traumatized
- It's not therapy—it's a lens for how we design systems and respond

## 5. Epigenetic Consciousness

### What It Is

A designer-created framework specific to Giovanna that synthesizes multiple scholarly traditions. It views behavior through four interconnected lenses: **Lineage & Story** (family history, cultural context), **Environment & Load** (sensory, transitions, demands), **Nervous System** (regulation state), and **Meaning & Dignity** (how responses affect the child's sense of worth).

### How It Shows Up in Giovanna

- **Lens Cards**: The entire 4-lens architecture
- **Family Profile**: Cultural background, community affiliations, family narrative
- **Homeplace Supports**: Integrates identity, regulation, and relationship

### What It Does NOT Claim

- This is not an established academic framework—it was created for this app
- It synthesizes existing work but is attributed to the designer, not prior scholars
- It is an organizational tool, not a clinical diagnostic framework
